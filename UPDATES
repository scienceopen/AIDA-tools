AIDA_tools version Beta (20100318)

Updates:

Tomography:
* tomo_start_guess_altvar1 - a start-guesser with adaptive h0-n-width,
  this will return a better guess of the altitude and width of the
  aurora. This works as a rough automatic triangulation - but only
  with one altitude and width for the entire horizontal extension of
  the block-of-blobs.
* tomo_slice_i - version of slice that uses the proper orientation of
  the 3-D X, Y and Z grids.
* make_tomo_ops can now display where the 3-D block of blobs falls in
  the images. This requires that one makes projections of a flat
  Vem. See the tomo-examples.

Starcal:
* Now possible to remove a selected identified star from the Starcal
  menu in the starcal window.
* Several functions uses mouse graphical selection (ginput)
  (semi_autoidentify, triangulate, identify star) they now take
  keyboard-output from ginput, characters according to figure labels.

Spectral_cal:
* spc_spectral_int_conv2.m now accepts function handle for filter
  caracteristic

Overall:
* There is now a new version of the station position and station name
  files. Now there is one file per imaging system with the format
  StNr "station name" longdeg  longmin  longsec N_or_S latdeg  latmin  latsec alt 
  These files should be located in AIDA_tools/.data and have filenames
  ending in .stations, currently there are 4 .stations files: ALIS,
  Miracle HAARPOON and Xephem. 
* When reading data with inimg the metadata struct returned (o, obs)
  now contains some new fields: .longlat (will eventually replace .pos
  that will be obsoleted), .xyz and .trmtr. The last 2 fields give the
  cartesian position of the station relative to a "central station"
  and the rotation matrix between the station-local horizontal
  coordinates and the central coordinates, if this can be
  calculated. To get this there has to be a field .central_station
  in the pre-processing struct sent in to the inimg
  function. central_station should be the unique station identifier of
  the station choosen to be the origin of the cartesian horisontal
  coordinates central station. 

Minor fixes:
* Zoom will now by default be on at all times in starcal.
* The problem with sliders that dissapeared have now been fixed.
* For starcal - now the error-figure is opened at once.
* The HTML-documentation is now updated.

AIDA_Tools version 0.70710

Updates:

1, typical_pre_proc_ops now gives different settings depending on the
   file type argument it is called with. Most importantly, for others
   than 'alis' the quirky quadrant balancing is turned off.
2, The tomo_opts function now returns an array of structs instead of
   a struct with arrays. This makes it far easier to run the
   tomography with different subsets of images. Previously one had to
   make one such struct for each set of stations one wanted to run the
   tomography over.
3, An example of how to make inimg read a file with an image in an
   unknown file format is included.



AIDA_Tools version 0.70

Updates:

1, Updated the image reading functions to handle broken fits images. In
   case the fits-file does not contain a valid header an empty image is
   returned together with the header.
2, Improved reading of other file formats. Provided the pre-processing
   option struct contains a field 'filetype'
   [{'fits'}|'sbig'|'afrl-raw'] that have fits as default, but makes
   it possible to read SBIG files or Todd Pedersens Air-Force Research
   Labs raw images. For other file formats that matlab cannot read
   with 'imread' or load with 'load' tailormade data reading functions
   can be used if a function handle is supplied in the pre-processing
   options field 'read_data_fcn'. Then a function handle that produces
   an 'obs' struct should also be supplied. Either a function that
   parses a header in the field 'log2obs', or a function that takes
   the image file name in the field 'try_to_be_smart_fnc'.
3, A new non-parametric model for the optical transfer is
   introduced. (not guaranteed that all functions support it yet. This
   model is based on two 2-D to two 2-D interpolation mappings of
   smoothing surfaces from the image coordinates to the horisontal
   components of the pixel lines-of-sight.
4  Bits and pieces have been fixed.
   1, in the starcalibration work the colormap got realy boring in
      autoidentify mode. This was due to a 'bug' (or changed behaviour
      in matlabs contour function) this is now fixed.

AIDA_Tools version 0.7

There is a new release of the Auroral Image Data Analysis tools I presented in
January 2006. 

This, I think, is a more "ready" version of these functions in that it now has a
far cleaner structure and the m-files are now less scattered across my
matlab-directories. Thus, future bug-fixes and updates should be quicker and
less ad-hoc messy.

0, RELEASE

After the Image processing course I got a little bit wiser, not much
but enough to realize some improvements were needed to the overall
structure of my matlab routines and the documentation. Everything is
not yet finished but at least it is time to release the first version
of ADA_tools (ALIS Data Analysis tools). 

Some of the problems that were revealed and made the routines almost
nightmareish to use for others than me:
* Cumbersome at startup.
* Crashing when running in different matlab versions.
* Crashing on windows (and mac?)
* Lacking in documentation
* Not all image corrections properly done automatically.


This and other topics of the same nature made me realize that the
ALIS-related programs needed to be restructured signifficantly. Not in
any way that realy affects the user or change user interface, but
rather the file structure and what should be needed at startup. Then I
also realised that some additional calibration work would be good to
include, and then that an improved documentation and a thorough
tutorial would be good.

Now that the progress of the tutorial have come to a halt and the
calibration stuff might be updated at a later time it is overdue to
produce a new release of my matlab toolboxes for ALIS data analysis.

AIDA_tools = Auroral Image Data Analysis tools


IMPROVED FUNCTIONALITY.


Bias correction for ALIS data in most common binning configurations
for all cameras. Exactly what binning configurations differ from
camera to camera, look in AIDA_tools/.data/ccd#N for what binning-factor
we have bias corrections for CCD#N. For the absent ones the default is
to make an educated guess if bias correction is included in the image
pre-processing.

Various ALIS related data are stored in AIDA_tools/.data. The least
related but maybe most important to mention is the topography of
northern Scandinavia that is stored in the file NS-geography.mat.
To use the topography just load the file:

>> load NS-geography

Then either display it as an image (less useful):

>> imagesc(Nscand)

Or do something like this:

>> pcolor(long_Nscand,lat_Nscand,N_scand),shading flat
>> cmap = summer;      
>> cmap(1,:) = [0 0 1];
>> colormap(cmap)  

Most of the rest of the data files are handled automatically or
if not self explanatory at least "self figure-outable". 



IMPPROVED DOCUMENTATION


There was the ambition to have an extensive tutorial, more extensive
than the image processing stuff I presented in January. There is quiet
some work to do before that ambition is in put to rest. However there
are a beginning that contains some introductions, some worked examples
and a complete cross referensed source code documentation. Matlab has
some way of making this kind of html-documentation reachable from
within matlabs gui. This documentation is not reachable that way as
far as I know. The to-level start point is:

AIDA_tools/Documentation/index.html

Some links are still dead ends, but there should be somethings decently
working as well.



6, TODO


Pixel-2-pixel variation of sensitivity should be done real soon now,
but is not yet done. Then that image correction will be included by
default. This will not wait for a major update.

Update/complete the data base for camera calibrations. The data-base
of camera calibration parameters are not as complete as one could
wish. The plan was to have the functions reading ALIS data to search
that data-base and then select the best valid optical
parameters. However, since the data-base is not complete this has not
realy been achieved to the degree one could whish. Thus whenever you
do any camera calibrations with 'starcal' please send me the resulting
optical parameters together with the name of the fits file and
preferably also date and time of the exposure.
