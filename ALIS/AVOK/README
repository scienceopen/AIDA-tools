AVOK - ALIS View Overview Keograms

The tools for producing and viewing the ALIS overview keograms.

This was a toold built 2005 for making a keogram data-base of all ALIS
data taken. A data-base was made, the tools worked. One problem was
that the displays worked poorly for events with sparse data and data
with low or no signal.

To my knowledge the data-base have not been updated since 2005.

On the ALIS computer the data-base was located at /alis/overviews or
something similar.
