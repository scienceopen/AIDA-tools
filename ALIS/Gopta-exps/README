These scripts and the TO_GOPTA function produced working gopta files
for ALIS observation control - for a previous version of gopta. The
current gopta version have a far better and more modular set-up so now
it should "only" be necessary to produce filter-sequence files, and
then set the corresponding interval and exposure times.
