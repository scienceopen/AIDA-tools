-The EMCCD data already has a "dark" background removed from it.  This
was achieved within the andor software during data acquisition.  Prior
to each run, a background measurement (ie "dark") was recorded and
subsequently removed from each data file thereafter.  The dark count
is thus more noisy than it would have been if we had collected
numerous darks and averaged them to then remove from each data file
(as is usually the case for WCCCD for example).
