skymap;
[SkMp] = skymap;
[SkMp] = skymap(pos,time);
[SkMp] = skymap(pos,time,SkMp);

==============================================================
skymap.m
==============================================================
  skymap sets up a graphical user interface for 
  the skymap and an input figure for selection of 
  observation sites and date and time. The program should be called in
  one of the three ways above. Here it is important that the output
  argument is called 'SkMp', since the program stores its state
  and all variables in this struct and looks for it when used. POS is
  a 1 by 2 vector with latitude and longitude - positive east and
  north. Time should be in the format [yyyy m d h m s]. If you supply
  SkMp it should contain the correct fields.

==============================================================
date2juldate.m: [jd] = date2juldate(date)
==============================================================
  
  Function date2juldate(date) 
  calculates the julian date ( jd ) at 0h ut 
  takes input date as an array with date(1) <-> the year ( 1995 - 95 ) 
                                   date(2) <-> month 
                                   date(3) <-> day nr in month 

==============================================================
nutation.m: [N] = nutation(date,utc)
==============================================================

  Function that do _not_ calculate the correction matrix for
  nutation. It is left for other users to replace with a function that
  calculates the appropriate correction matrix. As of now it does
  nothing. Or rather give eye(3) - but as for rotation matrixes that is
  about just the same.

==============================================================
refrcorr.m: [apze] = refrcorr(ze)
==============================================================

  Function REFRCORR - a simple atmospheric refraction 
  correction function for zenith angles. 

==============================================================
starpos2.m: [az,ze,apze] = starpos2(ra,decl,date,utc,lat,long)
==============================================================

  STARPOS2 - function that calculates the azimuth, zenith 
  and apparent zenith angles for a sky object. 
  It makes some good corrections for precession.

  Input:  ra <-> right acsention of the object in hour 
          decl <-> declination of the object in degrees 
          date <-> date for the observation. Date = [year month day] 
          utc <-> utc time for the observation. UTC = [hour minute second] 
          lat <-> latitude of the observer in degres 
          long <-> longitude of the observer 
  Output: az <-> azimuth angle clockwise from north in radians 
          ze <-> zenith angle in radians 
          apze <-> apparent zenith angle in radians

==============================================================
utc2losidt.m: [localsidtime] = utc2losidt(date,utc,longitud)
==============================================================
  
   Function UTC2LOSIDT calculates the local sidereal time. 
   Takes date and utc and longitude as argument. 
   date(1) <-> the year ( 95 <-> 1995 ) 
   date(2) <-> month 
   date(3) <-> day nr in month 
   utc(1) <-> hh 
   utc(2) <-> mm 
   utc(3) <-> ss.ms 
   longitude in degrees!

==============================================================
utc2sidt.m: [sidtime] = utc2sidt(date,utc)
==============================================================
   
   Function UTC2SIDT calculates the sidereal time. 
   Takes date and utc as argument. 
   date(1) <-> the year ( 1995 - 95 ) 
   date(2) <-> month 
   date(3) <-> day nr in month 
   utc(1) <-> hh 
   utc(2) <-> mm 
   utc(3) <-> ss.ms

==============================================================
the rest.m
==============================================================

  The remaining functions are more or less background functions
  that are appropriately accessed through the GUI.

==============================================================
User tuning
==============================================================

To modify the list of observation sites and observation
positions, all a user need to do is to modify/add/remove
as wanted in the files Stations/station.name and
Stations/stationpos.dat.

To include higher order corrections in the positions the
user can modify the functions refrcorr.m and nutation.m
