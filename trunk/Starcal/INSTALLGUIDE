Installation

Installation of starcal should be absolutley
straghtforward on all systems with MATLAB version 5.1 or later.

`Starcal' depends on `Skymap', `Camera' and `Fits_tools'. Further it
depends on Dr. Erik A. Johnson's <JohnsonE@usc.edu> arrow.m. It also
loads some data that by default are stored in ~matlab/.data/. Finally
it benefits from the optimization toolbox and might require the
image-processing toolbox from Mathworks.


For proper working of this tool it is necessary to put all the
directories listed below into your matlab path:

Camera/
Fits_tools/
Starcal/
Starcal/update/
Starcal/IOfcns/
Skymap/

There is for some forgotten reason necessary to put `Starcal' before
`Skymap' on the path. Otherwise there should be no problems with
comutating the directories.
