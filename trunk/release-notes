AIDA-tools-gamma (20121204)

This release of AIDA-tools is a gamma-version, where most
functionalities have been tested by me at some stage. A rather large
number of smaller and larger changes and new features have been
made. However, there still remains a couple of things to fix. But to
get the new versions, improvements and functions tested and used it is
just as well to make this release now rather than later.

The main known shortcommings here is the documentation - the
cross-referenced html-source-code documentation has not yet been
updated and is a bit our of date. Some functions in the Tomography
directory is not completely tested. Further a number of files with
obsolete functions that should be removed are still lingering around
due to my lack of SVN-adeptness.

AIDA-tools-beta (20100321)

This is a beta-release where some functions have not gone through a
thorough testing. Some ALIS-related scripts for plotting the
pre-determined ALIS observation positions in the AIDA_tools
directory is known to be not working - due to not being upgraded to
the new version of aida_visiblevol.m
