         <h2>to_gopta - how to<a name="1"></a></h2>
         <p>The process of producing working experiment configuration files for ALIS would be difficult for simple experiment - if one
            were to use one and the same filter sequence for all stations. With different filter sequences at different stations this
            would soon turn into a typing nightmare.
         </p>
         <p>Fortunately there is help nearby when needed. The ALIS toolbox includes a function to_gopta that rapidly produces experiment
            files for each station - at the same time it even produces documentation of the filter sequences for each station.
