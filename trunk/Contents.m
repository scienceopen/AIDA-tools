% AIDA_tools contains functions for geometric and absolute camera
% calibrations, image maping and projection functions, image
% analysis and processing functions, functions for reading and
% processing fits-files and other scientific-type file formats, as
% well as functions for tomography-like inversions, and 3-D
% intensity functions related to 3-D continuity equation
% solutions.
