TODOs remaining after 20120711

Tomography:
* Make the scaling-magical-constant-thingy!

Documentation

* Make more extensive documentation
* Check how to make documentation included into matlab's internal docs.
* Update Contents.m

Fits_tools
* Check how to do the byte-swapping in READ_AFRL_KEO for the header
  pixels

* Include AKAIKE!

##### These are for later: #####

Spectral_cal:
*  Later: Make functions that use Pickles!

Starcal:
* Later: Come up with some quality measure of a geometric star calibration
  to make it possible to choose the best for cases where several has
  been done. According to number of identified stars and total error
  or something like that.

Imgtools:
 *  Later: deconvcrude - fix this one up with damping and bells and whistles!

##### Next major rewrite: #####

Change structure of optpar/acc to:

[StnNr CmNr img_date long lat az ze optmod rot1 rot2 rot3 f1 f2 du dv alpha1 ...]

This would make it less problematic to use optical parameters with
varying number of parameters in camera models. The downside is that
the structure of the star-fitting optimisation functions has to be
rewritten with the fcnnmn(VarPar,vpIdx,AllPar,restInputVars...)
pattern, with the inputting of the variable parameters, VarPar into
the "all parameters array", AllPar (i.e. AllPar(vpIdx) = VarPar;). 
This is a fairly major rewrite since it will also include changing all
functions that use the optical parameters and call most of the
functions in the Camera directory. What files needs to be modified,
with the lines containing optpar listed, are given in the file
optp.files. This might be a tedious refactoring task and requires a large
programming effort to pay off - it might be a good task for someone
trying to learn AIDA_TOOLS in depth. I estimate this to be about a 2-3
month task, including proper testing.
