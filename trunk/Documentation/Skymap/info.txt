# A basic set of bright stars.
# Based on the 5th Revised edition of the Yale Bright Star Catalog, 1991, from
# ftp://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/adc/archives/catalogs/5/5050.
# Only those entries with a Bayer and/or Flamsteed number are retained here.
# Format: Constellation BayerN-Flamsteed, as available. Bayer is truncated as
#   requried to enforce a maximum total length of 13 imposed within xephem.
# Common names were then overlayed by closest position match from hand-edited a
# list supplied by Robert Tidd (inp@violet.berkeley.edu) and Alan Paeth
# (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu)
