      <h1>Skymap</h1>
      A medium accuracy star chart/sky map/ephemeris program for
      matlab.
      <a href="../images/skymap_fig02.jpg"><img ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=11

	  main figure"></a> 
      <h3>What does it provide?</h3>
      <p>
      This program provides an easy to use sky map with 
      medium accuracy. That is it plots the stars as they would be
      seen in the sky from a given point on the earth at any given
      time. What is meant by ``medium accuracy'' is that the higher
      order corrections (nutation, proper motion, parallax) for
      calculating the azimuth and zenith position of the stars is
      not taken into account.<BR>
      Due to lack of marked needs, the program currently only plot he
      stars from the 
      <a
      href="ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/V/50">Bright Star Catalog (BSC)</a> 
      <!--       <a -->
      <!-- 	 href="ftp://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/adc/archives/catalogs/5/5050">Bright Star Catalog (BSC)</a>  -->
      and no planets or other bright celestial objects.
      </p>
      <p>
      In addition stellar spectra from the Pulkovo Spectrophotometric
      Catalog can be extracted - for the 600-900 stars that have their
      absolute spectral intensities tabulated.
      </p>
      <p>
	The features are:
      <ol>
	<li>Rect ascension/Declination or Azimuth/Zenith grid</li>
	<li>slide rulers for field-of-view and <em>THREE</em> rotation
	  angles of the f-o-v.</li>
	<li>Pop-up menu for faintest magnitude</li>
	<li>Preference dialog for plot colors and sizes</li>
	<li>Easily editable files of observatory names, and
	  positions.</li>
	<li>Integrated with the Pulkovo spectroscopic catalog -
	  providing stellar spectra with 5&nbsp;nm resolution from 300-1100&nbsp;nm</li>
	<li>Integrated with the <a href="../starcal.html">StarCal</a>
	  camera calibration program.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Installation.</h3>
      Simple. Really. 
      <ol>
	<li>Put the tar file to somewhere you want your mat-files, like
	  ~/matlab</li>
	<li>tar -xvf Skymap.tar</li>
	<li>Add the Skymap directory to your matlab-path.</li>
	<li>Done.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Customization</h3>
      Not very much to customize, except the list of observation
      sites. This is easily don by modify/add/remove
      as wanted in the files .data/station.name and
      .data/stationpos.dat. In stationpos.dat the format is
      <pre>
  67 50 26.58777 1 20 24 40.4508  1
      </pre>
      <pre>
degrees arc-minutes arc-seconds NS-flag  degrees arcmin arcsec EW-flag
      </pre>
      Here NS-flag and EW-flag is positive for north and east
      respectively.
      <p>
	A significantly more cumbersome customization is to add other
	star catalogs to the program.<br>
	The best way to do this is to
	rewrite the functions related to loading the star catalog, if
	you need to do this <a href="mailto:bjorn@irf.se">please
	  contact the author for help</a> or 
	<a href="../../Html-docs/Skymap/read_ybs.html">consult the source code documentation</a>. <br>
	The easier way is possibly just to append additional stars into
	the files stars/ybs.bjg and stars/ybs.org. This will of course
	make the somewhat slow loading of the stars even slower.
      </p>
      <h3>Run the program</h3>
      At the matlab prompt any of the following function calls will work:
      <pre>
 [SkMp] = skymap;
 [SkMp] = skymap(pos,time);
 [SkMp] = skymap(pos,time,SkMp);
      </pre>
      for programming reasons it is necessary to literary name the
      output SkMp. &quot;pos&quot; should be a 2x1 vector with [lat
      long] in degrees with north and east positive, and time should be
      a 6x1 vector with format [yyyy mm dd hh mm ss.fos]. With no
      arguments passed you will be prompted with a
      <a href="../images/skymap_fig01.jpg">figure to select date and
	time (UT) and observation position</a>. When pressing
      &quot;Ok&quot; the program will load the star catalog and calculate
      the positions of the stars. The usage of the GUI is
      straightforward, the top slide ruler change the field of view the
      right one change the rotation around the middle of the
      field-of-view, the left and right rotates the field of view around
      east-west and north-south. The pop-up menu sets the faintest stars
      to display. From the &quot;Star&quot; menu you can select Ra/Decl
      or Az/Ze grid and get information on a specific star. From the
      &quot;Pos/time&quot; you can request the current values or change
      to a new set of parameters. From the &quot;File&quot; menu you can
      print the sky map, close the session, and set various
      preferences.
