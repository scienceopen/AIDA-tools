    <h1>Stereoscopic triangulation</h1>
    <h2>1 Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Provided that there exist 2 images of the same object, most likely
      clouds, taken from two locations it is possible to determine the
      distance to various features that appear in both images. Thus it is
      also possible to determine the altitude of the features identified.
      This is provided that the <A HREF="optics.html">optical characteristics</a>
      and the <A HREF="rotations.html">rotations</a> of the cameras are
      well known. Another thing that need to be sufficiently well
      determined are the locations of the imaging sites - at least their
      relative positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently it is possible to analyze images made with optics that are
      described by any of the following <A HREF="optics.html">optical transfer functions:</a>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Pinhole camera model</strong><br>
	Where <math>x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup> = f*tan(theta)</math>
      </li>
      <li><strong>NIPR camera model</strong><br>
	Where <math>x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup> = f*sin(theta/alfa)</math>
      </li>
      <li><strong>ALIS camera model</strong><br>
	Where <math>x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup> = f*(1-alfa)*tan(theta)+f*alfa(theta)</math>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Kiruna all-sky camera model</strong><br>
	With a slightly more complex function that relates the direction in space to 
	the position ( x, y) in the image.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Pinhole camera with half spherical backside</strong><br>
	Where <math>x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup> = f*(theta)</math>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Where theta is the angle relative to the polar axis and f is the focal width.<br>
      For the ALIS camera model alfa is a weighting parameter.<br>

	coordinate system"><br clear> 
    </p>
    <h2>2 Working procedure</h2>
    <img src="images/stereo01.jpg" ALT="PSC image pair"><br clear>
    <p>
      With images from two sites of the same object as in
      figure 1 and figure 2 above the working procedure
      is:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	A cross-hair appears in fig 1.
      </li>
      <li>
	Identify a feature that appears in both images press
	the left mouse button with the cross-hair above the feature. 
      </li>
      <li>
	A cross-hair appears in fig 2,
      </li>
      <li>
	Identify the same feature in this image press the left mouse button 
	with the cross-hair above the feature. If the feature seems to have
	disappeared or if you get second thoughts about the identification, then
	this is the time to press the right mouse button to skip this point for now.
      </li>
      <li>
	Then the line of sight vectors <math>e( x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub> )</math>
	<math>e( x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub> )</math>
	is determined for the identified pixels <math>(x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>)</math>
	<math>(x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>)</math>.
      </li>
      <li>
	The middle point on the shortest line connecting the two lines
	specified by the camera positions and the lines of sight is taken
	the "true" point in space of the identified feature.<br>
	<img src="images/stereo02.jpg" ALT="Crossing lines-of-sight"><br clear>
      </li>
      <li>
	The distance of the shortest connection is given as a
	quality measure of the identification. If the distance
	is far too long it seems likely that the identification
	are somewhat doubtful and the user can skip the point.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Repeat this procedure 1-7  until there are no more common features
      or You are satisfied, then press the middle mouse button.
    </p>
    <p>
      The set of points that are identified 
      <math>( x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>) )
	( x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>2</sub>) ),... ...,
	( x<sub>n</sub>, y<sub>n</sub>, z<sub>n</sub>).</math>. can be viewed on as a set
      of sample points from a surface. Over this set
      of irregularly samples a Deluanay triangulation is made to get a regularly
      spaced surface grid.
    </p>
    <h2>4 Results</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="images/stereo03.jpg" ALT="Triangulated cloud surface"><br clear>
      The resulting altitude maps and the part of the images
      that are enclosed by identified points is plotted in the two
      image windows. The results are stored in file if the user
      so wishes. The triangulated surface is returned to the
      matlab workspace in the variables:<br>
      x<br>
      y<br>
      z<br>
      and the plots can later on be reproduced with the command sequence:<br>
      
    <pre>
bxy1 = size(currmatr1);
bx1 = bxy1(1);
by1 = bxy1(2);

xi = 1:10:bx1;
yi = 1:10:by1;
cm1 = currmatr1(xi,yi);
[xi,yi] = meshgrid(xi,yi);
xii = 1:bx1;
yii = 1:by1;
[xii,yii] = meshgrid(xii,yii);

pcolor(x,y,cm1),shading 'flat'

hold on
[cs,h] = contour(x,y,z,'g');
axis('equal')
xlabel('Horizontal distance from Kiruna (km) West <-> East')
ylabel('Horizontal distance from Kiruna (km) South <-> North')
clabel(cs,h)
drawnow
    </pre>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes it is decidedly difficult to identify an object seen
      from two sites when the scattering angle from the sun is quiet
      different - as in the case showed here, where in the image from
      Kiruna (left) the light is scattered almost 180 degrees while in
      the other image the scattering angle is something like 30
      degrees.
