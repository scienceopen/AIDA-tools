      <h1>Starcal</h1>
      <h2>1 Introduction and overview</h2>
      <p>
	<strong><SPAN class="LI-HD">Starcal</SPAN></strong> is a (matlab)-program for determination
	of <a href="rotations.html">camera rotations</a> and
	<a href="optics.html">camera characteristics</a>. Geometrical
	camera calibration is of vital importance for more advanced
	image analysis such as tomographic inversion, stereoscopic
	triangulation. For these and other methods it is necessary to
	accurately know the pixel line-of-sight of each and every image
	pixel. With the STARCAL function this camera calibration is
	performed by identifying stars in images and comparing their
	position with the calculated star positions. In this way both
	the camera rotation and the camera model can be determined with
	high accuracy. <br>
	The PhD thesis <a	href="http://www.irf.se/~bjorn/thesis/thesis.html">
	  Three dimensional imaging of aurora and airglow</a>
	contains a chapter that gives a more in depth description of
	this method: <a href="http://www.irf.se/~bjorn/thesis/node14.html">
	  Geometrical calibration of ALIS</a>.

      <h2>2 Working procedure.</h2>
      <ol>
	<li><strong><SPAN class="LI-HD">Load an image</SPAN></strong>
	where it is possible to identify at least some 15 stars. If
	the sensitivity is to low or the noise-level to high it have
	been found that even images from really low-performing
	web-cams can be used in &quot;differential mode&quot; where
	the difference between two images taken a few minutes apart
	have been used - in this way the &quot;fixed pattern
	noise&quot; canceled out. <BR>
	Accepted image formats: FITS and other raw-data image
	formats that has reader-functions in the Fits_tools directory,
	all image formats that your version of MATLAB reads.<br>
	To make the geometrical calibration possible the accurate
	position of the stars in the ske has to be calculated. In
	order to do so both the time of observation (date, UTC time)
	and location (latitude, longitude) has to be known. If an
	image file in a standard format is used, without any special
	meta-data extraction provided the image reading function will
	query for this information. The meta-data "production" can be
	automated in various ways, see below. If you have an image in
	fits format that contains some additional keywords that give
	information on observation site, date and time of exposure and
	general viewing direction of the camera this will be read and used.
	<a href="ALIS-header.txt">Provided they comply with this (Or
	    any other identifiable ALIS) key-word formats...</a>
	Otherwise you can write a small function that returns a
	struct with the required meta data according to one of the
	two calling formats
	<a href="../Html-docs/Fits_tools/inimg.html">inimg.m</a>
	expects, short of that you might still
	be prompted for the necessary, and some helpful information.<br>
	To take control over the sometimes important and often
	necessary image preprocessing proceed like this when loading
	the image:

	  documentation.
	</li>
	<li><strong><SPAN class="LI-HD">Image display</SPAN></strong>
	  <a href="images/starcal_fig1.jpg"><img ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10
	      VSPACE=5 HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=180
	      src="images/starcal_fig1.jpg"></a> 
	  The image is displayed ( fig. 1 ) with the stars overlaid.
	  The image positions of the stars are calculated with the
	  initial guess of the camera rotations and optical
	  characteristics. The star catalog that are included by default
	  are the <a href="Skymap/info.txt">Yale Bright Star
	    catalog</a> with stars down to magnitudes between 5.5 and
	  6. For more information on the star catalog and the ephemeris
	  calculations: <a href="Skymap/index.html">Skymap</a><BR>
	  With slide rulers/scroll bars at the bottom (1)
	  and to the left (2) you change the east-west and north-south
	  rotation of the camera. With the pop-up-menu (3) you change the
	  magnitude of the faintest stars to overlay. With the upper
	  slide-ruler (4) you change the focal length of the
	  camera/field-of-view. And finally with the right slide ruler
	  (5) you change the camera rotation around the optical
	  axis.<br>
	  To make the stars appear clearly above the background it is
	  preferably to set matlab's colormap to something that works
	  better than the default (jet), personally I prefer:
	  <pre>
colormap(bone) % For list of colormaps see help graph3d
	  </pre>
	  since this gives the 
	  <a href="http://www.alis.irf.se/alis/cgi/index.cgi"> ALIS images</a> an
	  appearance not to far away from the night sky, which helps the
	  eye tremendously. Further it is	sometimes necessary to
	  manually set the limits of the color scale, in matlab this is
	  done with these commands:<BR>
	  <pre>
caxis     % without argument this give the current color-axis-limits
ans =
          55.5        33247
caxis([60 3500]) % To get a good caxis try stepwise.
	  </pre>
	</li>
	<li><strong><SPAN class="LI-HD">Recognition</SPAN></strong>
	  The key step is of course to recognize the stars in the
	  image, once a constellation or a group of stars are recognized
	  what remains is more or less mechanical work. Provided the
	  initial guess of the rotation and the field-of-view of the
	  camera is good this should be easy. Otherwise you could
	  increase the camera field-of-view to get more stars projected
	  down to the image plate, this should help if the initial guess
	  of the rotations were off. If you realize that the stars and
	  the image are reflected you should just change the sign of the
	  corresponding focal width. If you need to mirror the star-field
	  around the vertical axis, change the sign of
	  <math>f<sub>u</sub></math>:
	  <pre>
SkMp.optpar(1) = -SkMp.optpar(1);
	  </pre>
	  The optical parameter corresponding to the vertical focal
	  width (<math>f<sub>v</sub></math>) is SkMp.optpar(2).<BR>
	  This can also be done with the "Flip" pop-up menu in the top
	  right corner.
	</li>
	<li><strong><SPAN class="LI-HD">It's EASY...</SPAN></strong>
	  If you have a good image with many clearly visible stars,
	  and you know the optical transfer function function of your
	  camera; then it should be possible to get a
	  <a href="images/starcal_fig2.jpg">fairly good fit between the
	    images and the starfield</a>, and for cases like that there
	  is a chance that the &quot;auto-calibration&quot; will work. You find
	  that as the last item in the &quot;StarCal&quot; menu.<br>
	  This function searches for &quot;starlike&quot; local maxima in the
	  image and the tries to associate those with the brightness stars
	  from the catalog that are in the f-o-v and then search for the
	  optical parameters. For the case referenced above the result
	  was so-so, the function made <a href="images/starcal_fig3.jpg">
	    a good fit but only accepted 9 stars in the image.</a>
	  <ul>
	    <li>This auto-calibration might turn out better if some
	      image pre-processing is done, possibly by median-filtering
	      the image (Set PO.medianfilter = 3) or by applying a
	      wiener filter (Set PO.medianfilter = -3). The
	      functionality is tested and various parameters are
	      selected that works for ALIS images (16 bits per pixel and
	      typical point spread of stars &lt; 1 pixel), selected but
	      hard-coded...
	  </ul>
	  For ALIS images we have been able to do miracle saves by
	  doing <em>starcalibration</em> on images taken shortly
	  before sunset. For this we used background reduction and
	  filtering along these lines:
	  <pre>
img = SkMp.img - medfilt2(SkMp.img,[61 61]);
img = wiener2(img,[3 3]);
SkMp.img = img;
	  </pre><br>
	  The first step makes a fairly hard background reduction
	  effectively reducing the large scale variations in the
	  image. The resulting image is kind of noisy which we reduce
	  in the second step. The final step is just to put the
	  image back in the SkMp structure.
	</li>
	<a name="starcal-identification"></a><li><strong><SPAN class="LI-HD">...but it's not enough</SPAN></strong>
	  To get a good fit over the entire image plate it is sometimes
	  necessary to identify images over the entire image plate, this
	  is mostly the case for cameras with larger f-o-v's such as
	  those used in the 
	  <a href="http://alis.irf.se/alis/alis/ccd.html"> ALIS
	    cameras</a> with <math>50<sup>o</sup>-90<sup>o</sup></math>
	  f-o-v. Then it is necessary to do manual star
	  identification.<br> 
	  
	  This works in the following steps:
	  <ol>
	    <li>Optionally zoom
	      in, click-and-drag, on a region where you
	      <a href="images/starcal_fig4.jpg"> 
		recognize the stars</a>.
	    </li>
	    <li><em>Magnification</em><BR>
	      From the &quot;StarCal&quot; menu select &quot;Magnify&quot;. Select a star
	      by centering the cross-hair on the star and
	      left-click. In the small zoom figure a narrower region
	      surrounding the star is displayed. The size of the
	      magnified region can be selected in the &quot;preferences&quot; menu
	      item.</li>
	    <li>
	      In the zoom window it should now appear 
	      <a href="images/starcal_fig5.jpg">a magnification of the
		region around the star</a>. If necessary move the center
	      of the display to cover the star well.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <em>Determination of star position.</em><BR>
	      Either choose &quot;autopick&quot; or
	      &quot;man.pick&quot; from the &quot;star&quot; menu. <em>autopick</em> give
	      you a cross-hair to select the center of the star and then
	      fits a 2-dimensional Gaussian to the magnified image
	      region. If this procedure are to slow or gives an
	      unsatisfactory result, which occurs if the star is close to
	      the noise level, you should revert to <em>man.pick</em>
	      which gives you a cross-hair marker to select the center
	      of the star, this time with fixed widths. The resulting
	      fits are presented as 2 contour plots the only important
	      thing is that <a href="images/starcal_fig6.jpg">the center
		of the Gaussian is well aligned with the center of the
		star</a>, if not you should repeat the 
	      procedure. 
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <em>Identification.</em><BR>
	      Now when You have recognized a star and determined its
	      position in the image it is time to identify ( connect ) the
	      star in the image with a star in the star chart/star
	      catalog. Select &quot;identify&quot; from the &quot;StarCal&quot; menu. A
	      cross-hair appears in the sky-view window. Center the cursor
	      on the selected star marker and press a button. A marker will
	      appear around the star closest to the point of
	      selection. Over the plot a text (Retry (l)| Quit (m)|
	      Accept(r)) will appear that tell You which action is
	      connected to each mouse-button. If the correct star is
	      encircled press the button corresponding to accept, if
	      wrong star is encircled press the button corresponding to
	      retry, if You get second thoughts and become uncertain
	      which star should be encircled press the button
	      corresponding to skip.
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      <em>Repetitive and laborious work</em><br>
	      repeat the above steps until You have found  15-25 stars
	      in the image. The stars should preferably be evenly
	      distributed over the image to provide a good match over
	      the entire field of view. This is important to get a good
	      determination of the pixel lines-of sight over the entire
	      image plate and in the subsequent step when the
	      semi-automated star search is applied.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	  
	</li>
	<li><strong><SPAN class="LI-HD">Determination of camera rotation and optical parameters</SPAN></strong>
	  Once you've identified a reasonable number of stars, as many
	  as possible or some 25-30, evenly distributed over the image
	  it is due time to determine an optimal set of rotations and
	  optical parameters. In order to do so select &quot;Search Optpar&quot;
	  in the &quot;StarCal&quot; menu. This will bring up this figure:<BR>
	  <img ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5 src="images/starcal_fig7.jpg">
	  Where the optical parameters to search for are presented

	  </ul>
	  <br clear>
	  If it has not been possible to identify more than a few (4-8)
	  stars it could be worthwhile to &quot;lock&quot; a few of the free
	  parameters, this is to avoid a strange optical characteristics
	  that might occur if the number of free parameters are close to
	  the number of well-known data values &quot;equations&quot;. This you do
	  by pushing the check-box for the free parameters. Typically du
	  and dv (the shift of the image projection of the optical axis
	  from the middle of the image) could be fixed to 0, and
	  likewise the focal width of the camera might be well known,
	  then the only remaining free parameters should be the three
	  camera rotations.<br>
	  To start the search push &quot;Search&quot;.
	</li>
	<li><strong><SPAN class="LI-HD">Search for more stars</SPAN></strong>
	  When the automatic optimization is done and the result looks good chose
	  &quot;semi-autoidentify&quot; from the &quot;StarCal&quot; menu. This procedure
	  will map all stars within the camera field-of-view to the
	  image with the given rotations and optical parameters. This is
	  done from the brightest stars to the faintest.
	  <img ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5 src="images/starcal_fig9.jpg">
	  When a star are
	  found to be in the  image the display in the zoom window will
	  be centered around that point. 2 contour plots will appear and
	  if there are good overlapping choose accept by pushing the
	  mouse button corresponding to accept...<br> If the matching is
	  poor then double press the mouse button corresponding to retry
	  then a repeated fit of a 2D Gaussian to the surroundings of the
	  star is made if the fit still is poor repeat the
	  &quot;retries&quot;. After a few trials with the automatic and flexible
	  fitting it will be replaced by first a wide circular Gaussian
	  and finally with a narrow Gaussian. When the fit is acceptable
	  chose &quot;accept&quot;. If no star is found or what could be a star
	  appear to have a fairly faint intensity over the image
	  background ( As is seen in the extra window that appears )
	  chose skip. It is also possible that the star is outside the
	  initially calculated region, especially when the stars
	  initially found by hand is poorly distributed in the
	  image. Then it is possible to walk around a little to see if
	  any star is found in the near vicinity. The
	  <a href="images/starcal_fig8.jpg">extra window</a>
	  contain line plots of the current region of the image ( in
	  dark blue ) and the 2D Gaussian ( in green ) and the region of
	  the image in which the 2D Gaussian is larger than 10 % of its
	  maximum is plotted in red. The dotted bright blue and the
	  yellow lines are the supposed +/-noise level.<br clear>
	</li>
	<li><strong><SPAN class="LI-HD">Final optimization</SPAN></strong>
	  Repeat the search for/optimization of the optical parameters
	  as described above.
	</li>
	<li><strong><SPAN class="LI-HD">Check of results</SPAN></strong>
	  After a successful calibration the results should be pleasing
	  to watch. There should be no large systematic errors anywhere,
	  and if there are some large errors it should be possible to
	  account them to miss-identification of a star. This is the
	  case for <a href="images/starcal_fig10.jpg">this plot of
	    &quot;error arrows&quot;</a> where the long arrow from approximately
	  (220, 220) is due to that. The overall spread of the residuals
	  should be within a pixel which
	  <a href="images/starcal_fig11.jpg">often is the case.</a>
	</li>
	<li><strong><SPAN class="LI-HD">Save the work</SPAN></strong>
	  Before quitting the star-identification work you should save at least the
	  variable SkMp.optpar to file. To do this you either choose &quot;Save
	  optpar&quot; from the &quot;StarCal&quot; menu or do:
	  <pre>
save myfilename.opt SkMp.optpar -ascii
	  </pre>
	  In the first case you save the optical parameters in the
	  <a href="Starcal/acc.html">.acc</a>
	  format otherwise in the <a href="Starcal/opt.html">raw optpar
	    format</a>.
	  
	</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
	With this task done you can utilize the very good knowledge about
	the orientation and optical transfer in further image analysis such as
	stereoscopic triangulation, wind-field determination and various mappings
	of the images.
