INSTALLING AIDA_TOOLS


To install it all you need to do is to:
a) Unpack it in the directory where you have your matlab files. (This
should be different from the matlab installation
directory. Prefereably in a directory "matlab" in your home
directory.)

> tar -xzvf AIDA-###.tgz

b) In the AIDA_startup.m file, edit the third line:

AIDA_root = fullfile('/home','bjorn','matlab');

For those working in Unix-like OSes you should just change the
directories to point to where you have your matlab directory (I
obviously have it in /home/bjorn/matlab/). For those that work under
non-unix OSes I think that you would have to modify the '/home' part
above - but I have no such experience, so I cant help out. Then put
the AIDA_startup.m in your matlab directory, this makes it possible to
add the necessary path to AIDA_tools from wherever you start matlab,
be it the home directory, or any data directory.


IMPORTANT NOTE: You should not install or write matlab-files to the
directories that hold matlab itself (matlabroot). Matlab keeps track
of which functions needs to be reread, and the files under the
matlabroot are assumed to be updated only when the matlab version
changes. Thus you realy should have your own matlab directory where
you have the matlab files related to your own projects.

c) move AIDA_startup from AIDA_tools/ to your matlab directory.

"STARTING" AIDA_TOOLS

To run AIDA_tools you will of course need a working matlab installation
on the computer. Then all paths will be set by running AIDA_startup at
the matlab prompt:

>> AIDA_startup

This should set all paths without any obnoxious questions or troubles. If it
works as intended it will also adjust the setup according to which matlab
version it is running in ( at least 6.X and 7.X) - some function calls are
modified between those releases.
