      <h1>Installation of Auroral Image Data Analysis tools</h1>
      <p>
	To install it all you need to do is to:
      <ul>
	<li>a) Unpack it in the directory where you have your matlab files. (This
	  should be different from the matlab installation
	  directory. Prefereably in a directory "matlab" in your home
	  directory.)
	  <pre>
 > tar -xzvf AIDA-###.tgz
	  </pre>
	  <a href="#AIDA-by-svn">OR if you want the last svn revision...</a>
	
	  <li>b) copy AIDA_startup from AIDA_tools/ to your matlab
	  directory. By putting  "startup files in a ~/matlab
	  directory they always are in the matlab path (where matlab
	  automatically looks for functions and scripts), this makes
	  it possible to add the necessary paths to AIDA_tools from
	  wherever you start matlab, be it the home directory, or any
	  data directory. 
	
	  <li>c) In the AIDA_startup.m copy, edit the third line:
	  <pre>
 AIDA_root = fullfile('/home','bjorn','matlab');
	  </pre>
	  For those working in Unix-like OSes you should just change the
	  directories to point to where you have your matlab directory (I
	  obviously have it in /home/bjorn/matlab/). For those that work under
	  non-unix OSes I think that you would have to modify the '/home' part
	  above - but I have no such experience, so I cant help out.
      </ul>
      <p>
	IMPORTANT NOTE: You should not install or write matlab-files to the
	directories that hold matlab itself (matlabroot). Matlab keeps track
	of which functions needs to be reread, and the files under the
	matlabroot are assumed to be updated only when the matlab version
	changes. Thus you realy should have your own matlab directory where
	you have the matlab files related to your own projects.
      </p>
      <h2> "STARTING" AIDA_TOOLS</h2>
	To start using functions from AIDA-tools you need to make sure
	that the paths to the AIDA-toold directories is added to the
	matlab path. To do this just run AIDA_startup by simply
	typing:
	<pre>
 >> AIDA_startup
      </pre>
      at the matlab command line prompt. This will set all paths in
      the right order, without any obnoxious questions or troubles. If it
      works as intended it will also adjust the setup according to which matlab
      version it is running in ( at least 6.X and 7.X) - some function calls are
      modified between those releases.
      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      AIDA-tools require a working matlab installation, it benefits
      from the image processing toolbox and the signal processing
      toolbox for some filtering functions (medfilt2.m, and
      medfilt1.m) and blockproc.m. There are also a possibility that
      dependencies on other toolboxes have penetrated into the code,
      but I have not heard anything about that. AIDA-tools work best
      under more recent versions of matlab (7.x) but it has been run
      without flaws in matlab 6.5 and 6.2. Originaly AIDA-tools was
      developed on matlab 4.2 and 5.x. Most functions in AIDA-tools
      should work also in Ocatave, except the "Starcalibration"
      graphical user interface.
      
      <h2>Modifications</h2>
      When you realize that some function in AIDA-tools needs to be
      modified/extended/changed to suit your needs the best way to go
      about it is to copy the file to the
      <strong>MyAIDA</strong>-directory and modify that copy. The
      <strong>MyAIDA</strong>-directory is before the rest of the
      AIDA-tools directories in the matlab path, therefore matlab will
      find and use the edited file. The original copy of the function
      will still reside in its original location in case you'd need to
      revert to that. Also, when installing a newer version of
      AIDA-tools the edited version will survive without being
      overwritten. 
      <h3>SVN-installation</h3>
      <a name="AIDA-by-svn"></a>If you want the latest svn
      revision (and have a svn client installed) 
      <pre>
 > svn co "https://aniara.irf.se/svn/AIDA_tools/trunk" AIDA_tools
      </pre>
      If you are asked about a self-signed certificate, accept it permanetly.<br>
      <ul>
	<li>Q: What is svn? 
	<li>A: See <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com">http://svnbook.red-bean.com</a>
	<li>Q: How do I get a svn client?
	<li>A: svn clients for various operating systems can be found here<br>
	  <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html">http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html</a> 
	  but are usually installed on decent computers.
	  <li>Q: I changed AIDA_tools and wish to commit my changes?<br>
	  <li>A<ol>
	    <li>Obtain a username, a password for the svn repository at 
	      <a href="https:aniara.irf.se/svn">https:aniara.irf.se/svn</a> (contact <a href="mailto:urban.brandstrom@irf.se">urban.brandstrom@irf.se</a>)
	      You also need at least a very basic knowledge of svn.
	    <li>from the AIDA_tools directory
	      <pre>
 > svn commit -m "what you did and why"
	      </pre>
	      you will be asked for password
	      
	      should your username be different, try this instead:
<pre>
 > svn --username foo commit -m "what you did and why"
</pre>
